# Test Plan: Buggy Cars Rating QA Project

## 1. Introduction

**Project Name:** Buggy Cars Rating QA Testing  
**Project Description:**  
This project aims to deliver a complete quality assurance suite for the Buggy Cars Rating web application â€” a deliberately buggy web app used for practicing testing skills. The QA suite will include manual test scenarios, automated UI and API tests, usability, performance, and UAT testing.
